# Developmental Neurobiology with BrainSpan

This repository provides an interactive Jupyter notebook for exploring gene expression patterns within the developing brain, accompanied with data from the Allen BrainSpan Atlas. 

This project was developed at the [Cambridge Bioinformatics Hackathon 2018](https://www.cambiohack.uk/).
